# COSET

This repository holds a set of Rust types for working with CBOR Object Signing and Encryption (COSE) objects, as defined
in RFC 8152.  It builds on the core CBOR parsing functionality from the [`serde_cbor` crate](https://docs.rs/serde_cbor).

**Thist repo is under construction** and so details of the API and the code may change without warning.
